/**
 * How many packages a changeset's frontmatter names. Both quote styles count:
 * `changeset add` writes double quotes, and Prettier with `singleQuote` rewrites
 * them, after which a double-quote-only pattern counts zero.
 *
 * Scanned line by line rather than matched with one regex: a pattern that
 * spans the fences backtracks polynomially on a file of blank lines, and this
 * reads files a pull request can put anything in.
